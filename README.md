# File-Handling-and-Exception-Handling-Assignment

## Overview
This Python script combines two key challenges:
1. **File Read & Write Challenge üñãÔ∏è**: It reads a file, modifies its content (e.g., converts text to uppercase), and writes the modified content to a new file.
2. **Error Handling Lab üß™**: It asks the user to provide a filename and handles common errors, such as the file not existing or permission issues, gracefully.

By running this program, you'll get hands-on experience in managing files and implementing error handling in Python.

## Features
- **Read & Write**: Reads content from an existing file, modifies it (e.g., converts to uppercase), and writes the result to a new file.
- **Error Handling**: Handles errors like missing files or permission issues when trying to open and read a file.
- **User Interaction**: The program asks the user for filenames and choices, allowing for interactive execution.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## How to Run the Program
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the script.
4. Run the program with the following command:
```bash
python file_read_write_and_error_handling.py
```
5. Follow the on-screen prompts to choose between reading and writing files, and error handling.

## Outcomes üéâ
By the end of this module, I was able to:
- Read and modify files in Python.
- Handle errors gracefully when interacting with files.
- Build robust and user-friendly applications that can manage file operations.
